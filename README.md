# Practice react app
This is a simple task tracker follow up project from Traversy media's react course on YouTube.

## Highlights
- I learnt basic routing using react-router-dom and it's other available hooks such as useLocation
- I learnt how to break up an app into reusable components.
- I learnt how to make HTTP calls with all possible methods (post, delete, get, patch and put) using the fetch API and json-server for the backend.
